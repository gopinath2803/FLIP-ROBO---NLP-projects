The 2020 United States presidential debates are a series of debates for the 2020 United States presidential election. Debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates are scheduled to take place between September 29 and October 22, 2020
On October 11, 2019, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced it would host four debates, including three presidential debates between incumbent president Donald Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden and a single vice presidential debate[1] between incumbent Vice President Mike Pence and presumptive Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris.

In late 2019, Trump claimed the 2016 debates were "biased." After meeting with his campaign manager, the commission co-chairman said "that the president wanted to debate, but they had concerns about whether or not to do it with the commission."[2] Trump did not press the issue further publicly. Trump also pushed for additional debates to the traditional three, which Biden's campaign resisted.[3] At the end of June, representatives of the Biden campaign announced that they had agreed to the original schedule.[4]

In August, the CPD rejected a request by the Trump campaign to shift the debates to an earlier date, or to add a fourth debate
