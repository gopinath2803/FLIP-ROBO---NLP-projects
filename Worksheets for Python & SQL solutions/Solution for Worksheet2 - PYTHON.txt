Q11 to Q13 are subjective questions, answer them briefly
11. Differentiate between a list, tuple, set and dictionary.

Answer - A list is mutable - Ability to be mutated, to be changed. A list is mutable, so it is possible to reassign and delete individual items as well.
Tuple - It is immutable. This means that while you can reassign or delete an entire tuple, you cannot do the same to a single item or a slice.
set - not immutable, unlike a tuple.It will rearranged the elements in an ascending order , methods like discard(), pop(), clear(), remove(), add(), and more. Functions like len() and max() also apply on sets
dictionary - dictionary holds key-value pairs instead of single values, this differentiates a dictionary from a set.

12. Are strings mutable in python? Suppose you have a string ‚ÄúI+Love+Python‚Äù, write a small code to replace ‚Äò+‚Äô
with space in python.

Answer - No , string is immutable. You cannot overwrite the values of immutable objects. However, you can assign the variable again.

Program:
Samplestring = 'I+Love+Python'
replaced_Samplestring = Samplestring.replace('+', ' ')
print('Original string:', Samplestring)
print('Replaced string:', replaced_Samplestring)

Output:
Original string: I+Love+Python
Replaced string: I Love Python

13. What does the function ord() do in python? Explain with example. Also, write down the function for getting
the datatype of a variable in python.

Answer - The ord() function returns the number representing the unicode code of a specified character.

Program:
x = ord("h")
print(x)
Output:
104

Function of datatype of variable - A variable is a named location used to store data in the memory. It is helpful to think of variables as a container that holds data that can be changed later.
A constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed. It is helpful to think of constants as containers that hold information which cannot be changed
Every value in Python has a datatype. Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes

Q14 and Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook.
14. Write a python program to solve a quadratic equation of the form ùëéùë•
2 + ùëèùë• + ùëê = 0. Where a, b and c are to
be taken by user input. Handle the erroneous input, such as ‚Äòa‚Äô should not be equal to 0.

15. Write a python program to find the sum of first ‚Äòn‚Äô natural numbers without using any loop. Ask user to input
the value of ‚Äòn‚Äô.
