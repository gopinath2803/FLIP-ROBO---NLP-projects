Q11 to Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook.
11. Write a Pandas program to create and display a DataFrame from the following dictionary data and labels:
exam_data = {'name': ['Anastasia', 'Dima', 'Katherine', 'James', 'Emily', 'Michael', 'Matthew', 'Laura', 'Kevin',
'Jonas'],
 'score': [12.5, 9, 16.5, np.nan, 9, 20, 14.5, np.nan, 8, 19],
 'attempts': [1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1],
 'qualify': ['yes', 'no', 'yes', 'no', 'no', 'yes', 'yes', 'no', 'no', 'yes']}
labels = ['I’, ‘II’, ‘III’, ‘IV’, ‘V’, ‘VI’, ‘VII’, ‘VIII’, ‘IX’, ‘X’]
Answer:- ## Below is the lines of codes ##
	import pandas as pd
	import numpy as np
	exam_data = {'name': ['Anastasia', 'Dima', 'Katherine', 'James', 'Emily', 'Michael', 'Matthew', 'Laura', 'Kevin',
	'Jonas'],
	 'score': [12.5, 9, 16.5, np.nan, 9, 20, 14.5, np.nan, 8, 19],
	 'attempts': [1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1],
 	'qualify': ['yes', 'no', 'yes', 'no', 'no', 'yes', 'yes', 'no', 'no', 'yes']}
	labels = ['I', 'II', 'III', 'IV', 'V', 'VI', 'VII', 'VIII', 'IX', 'X']
          
	df = pd.DataFrame(exam_data, index = labels)
	df





12. Write a Pandas program to get the first 5 rows of the DataFrame created in Q11.
Answer:- df.head()





13. Write a Pandas program to select the 'name' and 'score' columns of the DataFrame created in Q11.
Answer:- print(df[['name','score']])





14. Write a Pandas program to select 'name' and 'score' columns in row indexes 3, 5, 6, 8 from the DataFrame
created in Q11.
Answer:- print(df[['name','score']][2:7:1])





15. Write a Pandas program to select the rows where the score is between 15 and 20 (inclusive) from the
DataFrame created in Q11.
Answer:- print("Rows where score between 15 and 20 (inclusive): ")
	 print(df[df['score'].between(15,20)])
