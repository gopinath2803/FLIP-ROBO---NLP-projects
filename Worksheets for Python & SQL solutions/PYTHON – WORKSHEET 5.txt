Q11 is subjective answer type question, answer it briefly.
11. List any two major differences between lists and sets in python.
Answer:- List: 1)List can be 2-D whereas a set can't.
	       2)As list are ordered (IE. have serial number) list are comparatively slow to execute whereas sets are fast.




Q12 to Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook.
12. write a python program to square the elements of a list by using list comprehension.
Answer:- # Below is the Code 
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

squared_numbers = [number ** 2 for number in numbers]

print(squared_numbers)






13. Write a pyhton program to drop duplicate elements from a list of numbers.
Answer:- ##Program to drop duplicate elements from a list of numbers.
a = [10,20,30,20,10,50,60,40,80,50,40]

dup_items = set()
uniq_items = []
for x in a:
    if x not in dup_items:
        uniq_items.append(x)
        dup_items.add(x)

print(dup_items)






14. Take two sets of numbers and try implementing the set operations - intersection, union, difference and
symmetric_difference between them.
Answer:- 
# Program to perform different set operations 
# as we do in  mathematics 
  
# sets are define 
A = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}; 
B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; 
  
# union 
print("Union :", A | B) 
  
# intersection 
print("Intersection :", A & B) 
  
# difference 
print("Difference :", A - B) 
  
# symmetric difference 
print("Symmetric difference :", A ^ B) 






15. Write a python program to add the elements of a set.
Answer:- # set of vowels
vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'u'}

# adding 'o'
vowels.add('o')
print('Vowels are:', vowels)

# adding 'a' again
vowels.add('a')
print('Vowels are:', vowels)
