C) 0 D) 0.159
Answer - B

14. Which of the following statements are true regarding the above documents?
A) The tf-idf score of “vapour” is greater than tf-idf score of “Bangalore” in document 1
B) The tf-idf score of “vapour” is less than tf-idf score of “Bangalore” in document 1

D) tf-idf of both “vapour” and “Bangalore” are equal and non-zero
Answer - B,D

15. Which of the following are advantages of using tf-idf model over BOW model?
A) The bow model gives equal importance to all the words while tf-idf model gives more importance to those
 words in a document which occurs exclusively only I this document .4
B) The tf-idf model gives equal importance to all the words in a document regardless of whether that word occurs
 in other documents or not, while BOW model takes in to consideration whether a word occurs in other
 documents also.
